Write a Python program that reads YAML files and prints out a CSV-formatted report that shows which student got the highest score for each assignment embedded in the YAML file. data1.yml is an example of such a YAML file. Assignment records may be found at any level of nesting and are identified by a key that starts with "assignment". sample_output.csv shows a partial output with the result of just the first assignment present in data1.yml. Your program's output, when run on data1.yml, should start with the first two lines in sample_output.csv but in total have 5 lines, spanning the 4 assignments present in data1.yml.
